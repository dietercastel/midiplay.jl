How to use BiVib with Native Instruments Kontakt 5 Player
----------------------------------------------------------

1. Create a new folder (for example, 'BiVib'). 
2. Extract into it the archive 'BiVib_Kontakt.7z' -> Various folders 
(e.g., ‘Instruments’, ‘Multis’) are created. 
3. Extract the multi-part archive 'Samples.7z.### -> A folder ‘Samples’ is 
created. 
4. Load the .nkm or .nki file(s) of your choice from the folders 'Multis' or 
'Instruments'

Notice that multis combine one binaural instrument (for example, 'Binaural Grand
[lid open]') with its corresponding vibration instrument (in this case,
'Vibration Grand') and route their outputs to 3 virtual outputs in Kontakt: a
stereo channel (outputs 1-2) for binaural signals, and a mono channel (output 3)
for vibration signals. It's then up to you to further route those channels to
some physical outputs of your audio interface, respectively to feed headphones
and vibration actuators.
